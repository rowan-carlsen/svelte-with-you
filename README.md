# <span style="color:#42b4ff;">I'll Stop the World and Svelte With You: Svelte 5 and SvelteKit for Web Dev</span>

## Viewing the Presentation

```bash
# Clone this repo and install its dependencies
npm i

# Then run a dev server and open it on localhost
npm run dev
```

The last "slide" of the presentation is a sandbox, designed to let you try out Svelte features immediately. Edit the `routes/sandbox/+page.svelte` file and the page will hot reload on save.

## Creating your own Svelte project

It's never been easier to start your own SvelteKit project. Use the commands below to create a new repo with the latest version.

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```
